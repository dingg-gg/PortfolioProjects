# PortfolioProjects
This repository contains all of my Data Analytics Projects.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Amazon Product Co-Purchasing Network (GCN)
**Tech:** PyTorch Geometric, GCN, t-SNE
* **Objective:** Classified 13,000+ products into 10 categories by leveraging co-purchase relationship "neighborhoods".
* **Result:** Achieved **~89.5% accuracy** using a 2-layer Graph Convolutional Network.
* **Insight:** Proved that structural co-purchase data is a more powerful predictor than isolated product features.

### 2. Retail Customer Segmentation
**Tech:** Python (Pandas/NumPy), RFM Modeling
* **Objective:** Segmented 500k+ transactions to identify high-value "Whale" customers and churn risks.
* **Result:** Identified that **10% of customers drive 60% of revenue** and flagged 130 "Slipping Whales" for re-activation.
* **Insight:** Developed targeted recovery strategies based on the top 5 historical affinity products for at-risk segments.

### 3. Mobile Game A/B Testing
**Tech:** Bootstrap Analysis, Python
* **Objective:** Evaluated the impact of gate placement (Level 30 vs. 40) on 7-day player retention for 90,000 users.
* **Result:** Found a **99.9% bootstrap probability** that Gate 30 maintains higher long-term retention.

### 4. Job Listings Web Scraper
**Tech:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests
* **Objective:** Built an automated scraper to extract structured job data from [Real Python Fake Jobs](https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/). https://roadmap.sh/projects/job-listings-scraper 
* **Process:** Implemented DOM traversal to target specific card-content classes and exported results into a structured CSV format.
* **Skillset:** Demonstrates proficiency in handling raw HTML and data cleaning using `.strip()` and tag filtering.

### 5. Spotify Trend Visualization
**Tech:** Tableau, Canva
* **Objective:** Analyzed a 20-year dataset of 2,000 songs to visualize shifts in musical mood and valence.
* **Insight:** Quantified a significant musical shift toward more melancholic and shorter-duration songs over time.
